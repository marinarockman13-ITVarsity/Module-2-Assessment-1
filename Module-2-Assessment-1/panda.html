                            <h3>PANDA</h3>
    <p>Pandas live mainly in temperate forests high in the mountains of southwest China, where they subsist almost entirely on bamboo.
         They must eat around 26 to 84 pounds of it every day, depending on what part of the bamboo they are eating.
         They use their enlarged wrist bones that function as opposable thumbs.

         A newborn panda is about the size of a stick of butter—about 1/900th the size of its mother—but females can grow up to about 200 pounds, while males can grow up to about 300 pounds as adults.
         These bears are excellent tree climbers despite their bulk</p>
     <p>A panda year is equivalent to about three human years in terms of life expectancy. Giant pandas live 18–20 years in the wild and 25 to 30 years in captivity.
          The world's oldest giant panda was Xinxing (‘New Star') in Chongqing Zoo at 38 years old and four months (1982–2020).
          That's the equivalent of 115 human years.</p>
  <p><h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</h3></p>
    <p>You will find the pandas at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>

                            <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
    <p>Warthogs, as one might guess from the name, are members of the Swine family and are related to pigs, boars and hogs.
         And as the name also suggests, warthogs have patches on their faces that look like warts, but are just thick growths of skin.
         These patches act as padding for when males fight during mating season.</p>
     <p>Warthogs travel in groups called sounders consisting of 1 or 2 sows and young offspring. Males usually travel alone.
        Boars have more prominent warts than sows. ...
        Warthogs use burrows for shelter and when entering, the hogs back in. ...
        Although they look fierce, warthogs would rather run than fight.</p>
  <p><h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</h3></p>
    <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>

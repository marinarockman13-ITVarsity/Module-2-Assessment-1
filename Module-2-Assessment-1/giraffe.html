                            <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
    <p>Giraffes are the world's tallest mammals, thanks to their towering legs and long necks. 
     A giraffe's legs alone are taller than many humansâ€”about 6 feet .
     These long legs allow giraffes to run as fast as 35 miles an hour over short distances and cruise comfortably at 10 miles an hour over longer distances</p>
     <p>giraffes have 3 hearts
        Three hearts, to be exact. There is a systemic (main) heart.
         Two lesser hearts pump blood to the gills where waste is discarded and oxygen is received.
         They work like the right side of the human heart</p>
  <p><h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</h3></p>
    <p>You will find the elephants at pen E22, right next to the amphitheatre.</p>

                            <h3>KOALAS</h3>
    <p>The koala is an iconic Australian animal. Often called the koala “bear,” this tree-climbing animal is a marsupial—a mammal with a pouch for the development of offspring.

        Though koalas look fuzzy, their hair is more like the coarse wool of a sheep. 
        They have two opposing thumbs on their hands, and both their feet and hands have rough pads and claws to grab onto branches. 
        They have two toes, fused together, on their feet, which they use to comb their fur.</p>
     <p>Koalas have strong arms, powerful legs and sharp claws suitable for climbing trees.
        Koalas are arboreal (tree dwelling) mammals, however, they do climb down to the ground to move between trees.
        Eucalyptus leaves are the main source of a koala's diet, and its digestive system has uniquely adapted to break down the harsh leaves. 
        Koalas are extremely picky with their food, but will occasionally branch out (literally) and eat from other Australian natives. </p>
   <p><h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</h3></p>
    <p>You will find the koalas at pen E23, right next to the restaurant.</p>

                            <h3>MONKEY</h3>
    <p>Monkeys are a large and diverse mammal group that includes most primates. Humans, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes)
         and other apes share an ancestor with monkeys but belong to a separate group of primates that diverged from monkeys millions of years ago. Monkeys are typically smaller than apes and usually have tails, which apes lack. The monkey group doesn't include lemurs, which are another branch of the primate family tree and live in Madagascar.

        There are a variety of monkeys, spread across the world, with very different lifestyles.
         They come in many shapes, sizes and colors, but they are all intelligent and social creatures.</p>
     <p>Monkeys are famous for eating bananas, but their diet varies considerably across species, depending on where they live and which foods are available.
        For example, saki monkeys may eat up to 50 fruit species in a single day, BBC News reported in 2013. 
        Most monkeys are omnivores; they eat plant-based foods, such as fruits and nuts, as well as some meat, such as lizards and bird eggs. </p>
   <p><h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</h3></p>
    <p>You will find the monkeys at pen E23, right by the monkey trail.</p>
